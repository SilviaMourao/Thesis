## Overview

This project, part of my MSc dissertation, introduces a novel methodology for assessing coastal risks due to sea-level rise. The case study focuses on the Ria Formosa natural reserve in Algarve, Portugal. The risk assessment integrates physical, socioeconomic, and environmental vulnerabilities to create a multi-parametric risk map. 

## Methodology

The methodology evaluates risks through three major components:
- **Physical vulnerability**: Using the IPCC RCP 8.5 sea-level rise model, erosion and accretion rates are assessed to determine hazard levels.
- **Socioeconomic vulnerability**: Population density, infrastructure, and potential damage costs are considered as indicators of risk to human communities.
- **Environmental vulnerability**: Ecosystem services are evaluated using expert surveys to account for the ecological risk of sea-level rise.

The resulting data are normalized and combined into a comprehensive coastal risk map for the region.

## Conclusion

This work highlights the importance of integrating environmental vulnerabilities into coastal risk assessments, providing a flexible framework that can be adapted to different case studies. The study stresses the need for national-level standardization in valuing ecosystem services for better coastal management.
